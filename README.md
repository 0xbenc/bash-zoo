## Installation and Usage

Follow these steps to clone the repository, grant execution permissions, and run the installer:

### 1. Clone the Repository

cd bash-zoo
```

### 2. Grant Execution Permissions to `wizard.sh`&#x20;

```bash
sudo chmod +x wizard.sh
```

### 3. Run the Installer

./wizard.sh
```

### 4. Follow the On-Screen Instructions

- Use `J` and `K` to navigate the script selection.
- Press `H` to toggle selection.
- Press `L` to confirm and proceed with installation.

### 5. Usage After Installation

Once installed, the selected scripts can be run from anywhere by simply typing their names (without `.sh` extension) in the terminal.

If your shell configuration supports auto-aliasing, restart your terminal or source your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash
source ~/.zshrc   # For Zsh
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the aliases, open your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) and remove the corresponding alias lines manually.

## Notes

- Ensure the `installers` and `scripts` directories exist before running `wizard.sh`.
- The script works on both Bash and Zsh shells.
- If no scripts are selected, the installation will exit without modifying the system.
